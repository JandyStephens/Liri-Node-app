# Liri-Node-app

EXAMPLE COMMAND:

`node liri.js <command> <search term>`

Attach a search term after one of the following command codes ( 'movie-this', 'concert-this', 'spotify-this-song') and info related to the search term will be returned.

For the'do-what-it-says' command, it will run whatever is entered in the random.txt file if it follows this format: <movie-this/concert-this/spotify-this-song>,<search term>.

If you do not enter a command at all, you will get an error that lists accepted commands.
